## Introduction

This repository is aimed at absolute beginners who want to learn Python programming. You'll find simple examples and explanations to help you understand the basics.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and start exploring the examples.



## Arrays (Lists)

In Python, arrays are called lists. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. You can create lists, access and modify their elements, and add or remove items from them.

## Sets

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Sets are unordered and do not allow duplicate values. You can create sets, add or remove items, and perform various set operations.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key-value pairs. A dictionary is a collection that is unordered, changeable, and indexed. You can create dictionaries, access and modify their items, and add or remove key-value pairs.

## Tuples
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection that allows you to group related data together. You can create tuples, access their elements, and perform various operations on them, but you cannot modify them after they are created.

## Basic Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

Linear search is a simple algorithm that checks each element in the list until the target element is found or the list ends. It is one of the basic algorithms you will learn in this repository.
## Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## classes
we are going to implement four pillars of oop
### 1. abstraction
Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
### 2. inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent).
### 3. polymorphism
Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. It allows the same interface to be used for different data types.
### 4. encapsulation
Encapsulation is about bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within one class and restricting direct access to some of the object's components
